in js make it so that when the new-note class is clicked, if anything is typed in the notes-text id, a new past-notes-box is each past-notes-box should be display flex.  When a new past-notes box is created, it should store all the text from the new-notes id and the new-notes id should clear out. When a new past-notes-box is created, the first 15 characters of the new-notes id will be the value of past-notes-box-title. The following 15 characters after those 15 from the notes-text id should be the value of the new past-notes-text-body. The date of when the new-note class is clicked should be the new value of past-notes-box-date in the form of mm.dd.yyyy at hh:mm:ss. All the new notes id text will be the value of past-notes-preview-box The dashes should be replaced with periods in the date. When any past-notes-box is hovered over, the active-selection class should be applied and go away once the hover stops. When a past-notes-box is clicked on, the stored contents of that specific new-notes id it stored should be the new value of the past-notes-preview-box. When past-notes-preview-open is clicked on that specific past-notes-preview-box, the value of past-notes-preview-box should replace the contents of the new-notes id. When past-notes-preview-delete is clicked, past-notes-preview-delete-ask-if-sure becomes display flex. From there, if the yes class is clicked, past-notes-preview-delete-ask-if-sure goes to display none again and the current selected past-notes-box and the contents it stores from that new-notes id will be deleted and the data will become a past-notes-trash-box. past-notes-box-title becomes past-notes-trash-box-title. past-notes-box-body becomes past-notes-trash-box-body. The value of past-notes-trash-box-date will be the time when the note was deleted. If the no class is clicked, past-notes-preview-delete-ask-if-sure goes back to display none. if past-notes-trash-button is clicked, past-notes-trash becomes display flex and past-notes-boxes go to overflow-y hidden. if past-notes-trash-button is clicked again, past-notes-trash becomes display none and past-notes-boxes goes back to overflow-y auto. 






  // when a theme-box is clicked, its theme replaces the theme of the notes container
  // Add a click event listener to the 'themes' element
  themes.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    // Find the closest ancestor with the class 'theme-box' from the clicked element
    const themeBoxes = event.target.closest('.theme-box');
    // Check if a 'theme-box' was found
    if (themeBoxes) {
      // Selecting the theme class which is the second class in the html class of notes-container and making it a variable
      const themeClass = themeBoxes.classList[1];
      // Call the changeTheme function with the extracted themeClass as an argument
      // Assuming changeTheme is a function that changes the theme based on the provided class
      changeTheme(themeClass);
    }
